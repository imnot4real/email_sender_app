# email_sender_app
A Python application that sends emails automatically based on email addresses in a CSV file, with a UI built using ttk.

To use this application:

Save the script to a file (e.g., email_sender_app.py).
Create a CSV file named `email_list.csv` in the same directory, with email addresses in the first column.
Install the required libraries (tkinter should be included with Python).
Run the script: `python email_sender_app.py`
